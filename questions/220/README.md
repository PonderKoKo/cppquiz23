### Thanks for helping!

Thank you for helping to port this question from C++17 to C++23.

You'll find the source code in [question.cpp](question.cpp), this should normally not need modification.

In C++17, the correct answer is:
> The program is guaranteed to output: `fhh`

Please verify that this is still correct in C++23. If it is, please do the following:
- Update [explanation.md](explanation.md):
  - Refer to the correct section numbers
  - Use updated quotes from those sections (the wording might have changed)
  - Make sure the rest of the text in the explanation is consistent with the new standard
- Update [hint.md](hint.md) if needed (usually not needed)

*Note that some older questions are missing references to the standard, we don't need to fix that now.*

If you get stuck, please describe the problem in detail in a comment to the issue, and a maintainer will add the `help wanted` tag so others can chime in.

If the correct answer has changed from C++17 to C++23, you can either just leave a comment in this issue, or see the instructions for [updating meta data](/METADATA_HOWTO.md).
