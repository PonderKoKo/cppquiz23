Static local variables are initialized the first time control passes through their declaration. The first time `foo()` is called, `b` is attempted to be initialized. Its constructor is called, which first constructs all member variables. This means `A::A()` is called, resulting in the printing of 'a.' However, `A::A()` then throws an exception; consequently, the constructor is aborted, and neither `b` nor `B::a` are actually considered constructed. In the catch block, 'c' is printed, and then `foo()` is called again. Since `b` was never successfully initialized the first time, it tries again, this time succeeding, which leads to 'ab' being printed. When `main()` exits, the static variable `b` is destroyed. This process first calls the destructor, which prints 'B,' and then destroys the member variables, indicated by the printing of 'A'.
